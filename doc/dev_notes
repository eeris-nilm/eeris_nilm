Training mode (continuous)

 - Measurement windows of 1 minute. Standardized input format.
 - Event detection
 - Persistent storage of events
 - Periodic clustering using DBSCAN (or other clustering method). Define update procedure (match with previous clusters, or update on existing clustering).

Note: If we re-run the clustering procedure, then any "designated" devices will be lost. We need to find a way to re-match or update the existing set of clusters.

Detection mode (continuous)

 - Is triggered when recording time and/or data volume crititeria are met
 - Starts from the training events
 - Matches them based on detected clusters
 - Implement triggers as needed

Visualisations (continuous)

 - Display power consumption
 - Display active appliances (or all)
